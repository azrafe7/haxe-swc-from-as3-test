haxe-swc-from-as3-test
======================

Testing generation and usage of Haxe3+OpenFl SWC (properties, overriding, hiding, etc.) from AS3. 

Launching `run.bat` will:

 - Clear output folders
 - Build Haxe version
 - Run Haxe version
 - Build SWC
 - Build AS3 version with SWC
 - Run AS3 version
 
**Note:** `mxmlc`, `haxe` and `lime` must be in the path. If you have FlashDevelop installed, `mxmlc` can be found in `c:\Program Files (x86)\FlashDevelop\Tools\flexsdk\bin\`. Tested on Win (7).
